          I'm a full stack developer. I got into programming because I enjoy
          solving problems and pushing myself to learn new things. It's
          satisfying to see how code can bring ideas to life.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of my wishes is to visit Switzerland at least once â€” the scenery
          there looks amazing. <br />I like taking on challenges, especially
          those that make me think differently or find creative solutions.
